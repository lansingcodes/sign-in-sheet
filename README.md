## Instructions

Anything appearing in red (including this message) will not appear in the printed version of this page.

Type your event name in the red box to the right of the logo. It will be centered correctly in the print version.

The print version is styled to look best with 1" margins on all sides of the page and no headers or footers.

You can also choose how many pages to print and whether to show line numbers using the form at the top of the page.
